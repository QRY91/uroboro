# Journey Timeline Implementation - Phase 3 Context Handover

## 🎯 **Current State Summary**

### ✅ **Phase 2 Completed (Current Status)**
The embedded template vampire has been SLAIN! 🧛‍♂️⚰️ After extensive debugging, we discovered that 1000+ lines of embedded HTML/CSS/JS in `internal/journey/server.go` was overriding our modern Svelte app. The timeline is now functional with proper event rendering and animation, but needs ghost event cleanup and UI polish.

### 🚧 **Current Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**
1. **Ghost Events**: Static event markers remain visible from initial load, don't disappear during timeline changes
2. **Layout Integration**: Need to restore the beloved 3-pane layout structure 
3. **Event Console**: Missing filtering options and event detail console
4. **Visual Polish**: Colors and animations need improvement
5. **Event Positioning**: Some events may not be perfectly synchronized with timeline scrubber

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Status**

### **Frontend: Svelte + TypeScript Stack (WORKING)**
- **Framework**: Svelte 4.2.12 + Vite 5.1.4 + TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Animations**: anime.js for smooth transitions
- **State Management**: Svelte stores with reactive derivations
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties with theme system
- **Build**: Working production builds in `web/dist/`

### **Backend: Go Server (FIXED)**
- **Location**: `internal/journey/server.go`
- **Status**: ✅ Now serves built Svelte app correctly
- **API**: RESTful endpoints working at `/api/journey`
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Embedded templates disabled (lines 326 & 1266)

### **Key Components Architecture**
```
Timeline.svelte (Main Container) ✅ WORKING
├── ViewportScrubber.svelte (Video-editor scrubbing control) ✅ WORKING
├── TimelineRuler.svelte (Top time axis with dates) ✅ WORKING  
├── TimelineEvent.svelte (Individual event rendering) ⚠️ GHOST ISSUES
└── Bottom Time Axis (Start/end times + duration) ✅ WORKING
```

## 🔥 **Critical Debugging Victory**

### **The Embedded Template Vampire 🧛‍♂️**
**Problem**: Server was serving old embedded "Journey Replay" template instead of Svelte app
**Root Cause**: Lines 326-1590 in `internal/journey/server.go` contained embedded HTML/CSS/JS
**Solution**: Disabled with comments:
```go
// DISABLED: const journeyCSS = `
// DISABLED: const journeyJS = `
```

### **Why This Was So Painful**
- Build process was working correctly
- Dist files were being generated
- Server logic looked correct
- Browser showed old interface despite cache clearing
- The embedded template was intercepting ALL requests before Svelte routing

---

## 🛡️ **Development Guardrails Established**

### **Standardized Workflow**
```bash
# THE ONLY WAY TO DEVELOP FROM NOW ON:
pkill -f uroboro || true
cd web && pnpm run build && cd ..
go build -o uroboro ./cmd/uroboro  
./uroboro publish --journey --days 7 --port 8080
```

### **Guardrails Script Created**
- **File**: `dev.sh` (executable)
- **Purpose**: Prevents template regressions
- **Features**: Auto-detects conflicts, builds correctly, verifies output
- **Usage**: `./dev.sh` instead of manual steps

## 🎨 **Current Visual State**

### **✅ Working Features**
- **Bright, modern UI**: Clean Svelte interface (no more fantasy elements)
- **Timeline scrubbing**: Smooth video-editor-style controls
- **Event animation**: Play button moves viewport through timeline
- **Time scales**: Multiple zoom levels (15m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, full)
- **Event markers**: Visible and positioned events
- **API integration**: Real journey data flowing correctly

### **⚠️ Issues to Fix**
- **Ghost events**: Static markers from initial load don't disappear
- **Missing 3-pane layout**: User preferred the collapsible panel structure
- **No event console**: Need filtering and event details panel
- **Basic colors**: Need prettier color scheme and animations

---

## 🐛 **Priority Issues for Phase 3**

### **🔥 High Priority (Core Functionality)**

1. **Ghost Event Elimination** 
   - **Problem**: Events from initial full-timeline load remain visible during scaled views
   - **Location**: `TimelineEvent.svelte` reactivity 
   - **Symptoms**: Static events at fixed positions that don't move or hide
   - **Debug**: Check `isVisible` calculations and viewport filtering

2. **3-Pane Layout Integration**
   - **Goal**: Restore the collapsible 3-panel structure user loved
   - **Components**: Timeline view + Event console + Controls panel
   - **Reference**: Previous implementation had good UX

3. **Event Console Implementation**
   - **Features**: Event list, filtering, detail view
   - **Interaction**: Click events to see details, filter by type/project
   - **Position**: Side panel or bottom panel

### **🔧 Medium Priority (Polish)**

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - **Colors**: More vibrant, themed color scheme
   - **Animations**: Smoother event transitions and hover effects
   - **Typography**: Better text hierarchy and readability

5. **Event Positioning Precision**  
   - **Goal**: Perfect synchronization between events and timeline ruler
   - **Check**: Events should move exactly with scrubber position

---

## 🛠️ **Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)**

### **Step 1: Fix Ghost Events (1-2 hours)**
```typescript
// In TimelineEvent.svelte - debug the visibility logic
$: if (!hasValidViewport) {
  isVisible = false;
  // Force re-render by updating position
  eventPosition = { x: -1000, y: -1000 };
}
```

### **Step 2: Implement 3-Pane Layout (2-3 hours)**
```html
<!-- In App.svelte - restore panel structure -->
<div class="app-layout">
  <div class="timeline-panel">
    <Timeline />
  </div>
  <div class="console-panel">
    <EventConsole />
  </div>
  <div class="controls-panel">
    <TimelineControls />
  </div>
</div>
```

### **Step 3: Create Event Console (2-3 hours)**
- Event list with filtering
- Click-to-select event interaction
- Project/type/tag filtering
- Event detail view

### **Step 4: Visual Polish (1-2 hours)**
- Improved color scheme
- Smooth animations
- Better typography and spacing

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Regression Prevention**
- [ ] Always use `./dev.sh` for development
- [ ] Verify "Uroboro Journey Timeline" title is served (not "Journey Replay")
- [ ] Check that embedded templates remain disabled in server.go
- [ ] Test timeline scrubbing moves events correctly

### **Ghost Event Debugging**
- [ ] Open browser dev tools, check `.timeline-event` elements
- [ ] Verify event `style` attributes update during scrubbing
- [ ] Check console for reactivity errors
- [ ] Test event visibility on scale changes

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Timeline loads without static ghost events
- [ ] Scrubbing moves events smoothly
- [ ] Play button animates through timeline correctly
- [ ] Scale changes (15m → 1h → 6h etc.) work properly
- [ ] Events only appear when timeline viewport contains their timestamps

## 🔧 **Development Environment**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ with pnpm
- Go 1.23+
- Modern browser with ES2018+ support

### **CRITICAL: Always Use Guardrails**
```bash
# NEVER do manual steps - use this:
./dev.sh

# OR the full manual process:
pkill -f uroboro || true
cd web && pnpm run build && cd ..
go build -o uroboro ./cmd/uroboro
./uroboro publish --journey --days 7 --port 8080
```

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check what's being served:
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -o '<title>[^<]*'
# Should show: "<title>Uroboro Journey Timeline"

# Check for ghost events:
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/journey | jq '.events | length'
# Should match actual event count in viewport
```

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Phase 3**

### **Must Have (Critical)**
1. **Zero ghost events** - Clean timeline that only shows events when viewport contains them
2. **3-pane layout restored** - User's preferred collapsible panel structure
3. **Event console working** - Click events to see details, basic filtering
4. **Smooth interactions** - No visual artifacts or positioning glitches

### **Should Have (Important)**
1. **Visual polish** - Prettier colors, smooth animations
2. **Event synchronization** - Perfect alignment with timeline ruler
3. **Mobile compatibility** - Touch interactions work properly
4. **Performance optimization** - 500+ events render smoothly

### **Could Have (Nice to have)**
1. **Advanced filtering** - Search, tag filtering, project isolation
2. **Event editing** - Modify events inline
3. **Export functionality** - Save timeline views
4. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Power-user navigation

## 📚 **Key Lessons Learned**

### **🧛‍♂️ The Embedded Template Vampire**
- **Always check for embedded HTML/CSS/JS** in Go servers
- **Symptoms**: Correct build, wrong interface served
- **Solution**: Comment out embedded constants, rebuild binary
- **Prevention**: Use `./dev.sh` guardrails script

### **🔄 Reactivity Debugging**
- **Ghost events** = reactivity not triggering properly
- **TypeScript helps** catch null/undefined viewport issues
- **Explicit dependencies** in reactive statements prevent race conditions

### **🛡️ Development Workflow**
- **Consistency is key** - manual steps lead to missed regressions
- **Automation prevents pain** - guardrails script saves hours
- **Document the pain** - use `uro -c` to capture debugging lessons

## 🤝 **Handover Notes**

### **Context for New Developer**
You're inheriting a timeline visualization that FINALLY works after slaying the embedded template vampire. The core functionality is solid - events animate, scrubbing works, API flows correctly. Focus on UI polish and ghost event cleanup rather than architectural changes.

### **Most Critical Files**
1. `internal/journey/server.go` - **DO NOT re-enable embedded templates**
2. `web/src/components/TimelineEvent.svelte` - Ghost event reactivity issues here
3. `web/src/stores/timeline.ts` - State management and viewport filtering
4. `dev.sh` - **ALWAYS use this for development**

### **Development Philosophy**
- **Reliability over features** - fix ghost events before adding new UI
- **User feedback is gold** - they loved the 3-pane layout, restore it
- **Guardrails prevent pain** - never skip the development workflow
- **Document with captures** - use uroboro itself to record lessons

### **Current Momentum**
The foundation is rock-solid after the vampire slaying. The timeline core works beautifully. Focus on polish and UX improvements rather than major rewrites. We're 80% there - don't let the last 20% take forever.

## 🎬 **Quick Demo Script**

```bash
# 1. Start with guardrails
./dev.sh

# 2. Open http://localhost:8080

# 3. Test these interactions:
#    - Timeline should load cleanly (no ghost events)
#    - Scrubbing should move events smoothly
#    - Play button should animate through timeline
#    - Scale changes should work without artifacts
#    - Events should only appear when viewport contains them
```

**Expected Result**: Clean, modern timeline interface with events that properly move with the viewport. No static ghost events. Smooth scrubbing and animation.
