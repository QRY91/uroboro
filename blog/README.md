# uroboro Development Blog

**"Version Control for Your Head"** - A blog documenting the development journey of uroboro itself, generated from actual development experiences.

## Philosophy

This blog practices what uroboro preaches: **turning development work into shareable insights**. Every post emerges from real uroboro captures, making it the ultimate dogfooding experience.

### Core Principles

1. **Technical Honesty**: Real timelines, authentic struggles, genuine breakthroughs
2. **Accessibility First**: Content and product designed for neurodivergent developers
3. **Meta Development**: Using uroboro to understand building uroboro
4. **Performance Focus**: Engineering lessons from real implementation challenges

## Writing Guidelines

### From uroboro Captures to Blog Posts

1. **Source Material**: Start with relevant uroboro captures
   ```bash
   uroboro query --tags "breakthrough,architecture,major-milestone"
   ```

2. **Timeline Context**: Use journey visualization to understand the flow
   ```bash
   uroboro publish --journey --days 1
   ```

3. **Authentic Narrative**: Tell the real story, including struggles and dead ends

4. **Technical Depth**: Include code examples, architectural diagrams, performance data

5. **User Value**: Always connect technical decisions to genuine user benefits

### Post Structure Template

```markdown
# Post Title: Clear Value Proposition

**Date** | *Category Tags*

Brief introduction that hooks the reader and explains why this matters.

## The Problem
Real challenge description with context.

## The Solution
Technical approach with code examples and diagrams.

## Implementation Details
Step-by-step breakdown of key decisions.

## Results & Impact
Measurable outcomes and user value delivered.

## Lessons Learned
What we'd do differently, what worked well.

## Looking Forward
How this affects future development.
```

### Voice & Tone

- **Conversational but technical**: Accessible to developers, technically accurate
- **Honest about challenges**: Don't hide struggles or failed approaches
- **Focused on value**: Always connect technical work to user benefits
- **Inclusive language**: Consider neurodivergent and diverse developer experiences

## Technical Setup

### Blog Generation Process

1. **Capture Development Work**
   ```bash
   uroboro capture "Major breakthrough description" --tags "blog-worthy"
   ```

2. **Review Timeline Context**
   ```bash
   uroboro publish --journey --days 7
   ```

3. **Extract Blog-Worthy Insights**
   ```bash
   uroboro query --tags "blog-worthy,breakthrough,major-milestone"
   ```

4. **Draft Post from Real Context**
   - Use actual timestamps and decisions
   - Include real code snippets and performance data
   - Reference specific uroboro captures for authenticity

5. **Publish & Share**
   - Add to blog index
   - Update landing page if major announcement
   - Share on social media with developer community

### Content Standards

- **Accuracy**: All technical details must be verifiable
- **Timeliness**: Document breakthroughs while insights are fresh
- **Accessibility**: Include alt text, clear headings, readable code blocks
- **Performance**: Optimize images, use efficient markdown structure

## Integration with uroboro

### Dogfooding Examples

The blog itself demonstrates uroboro's value:

1. **Canvas Timeline Post**: Generated from actual June 16, 2025 development session
2. **Architecture Decision Tracking**: Show how decisions evolved over time
3. **Performance Optimization Journey**: Document before/after metrics
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Track how user insights shape development

### Meta-Analysis Opportunities

- **Development Velocity**: Track time from capture to published insight
- **Content Quality**: Measure engagement with different post types
- **Technical Accuracy**: Validate engineering decisions over time
- **Community Value**: Assess which insights help other developers most
