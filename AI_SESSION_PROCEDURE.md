# Examples:
uroboro capture "PostHog Docker setup complete - all services running, first dashboard created" \
  --project posthog-integration \
  --tags "AI,infrastructure,milestone,posthog"

uroboro capture "Solved uroboro analytics integration issue - event batching prevents performance impact" \
  --project uroboro \
  --tags "AI,performance,analytics,solution"

uroboro capture "Strategic decision: Keep doggowoof in Go rather than Rust rewrite for timeline focus" \
  --project doggowoof \
  --tags "AI,strategy,language-choice,timeline"
```

### **Project Tagging Strategy**
- **posthog-integration**: PostHog setup, learning, integration work
- **uroboro**: uroboro development, features, analytics

- **qry-methodology**: Process improvements, systematic building
- **learning**: Technical skills, new concepts, educational content

### **AI Tagging Requirements**
- **ALWAYS** include "AI" tag for AI-recommended captures
- **Additional context tags**: technical area, outcome type, priority level
- **Outcome tags**: "milestone", "solution", "decision", "insight", "learning"
- **Technical tags**: "infrastructure", "integration", "performance", "debugging"

### **Capture Timing**
- **Immediate**: After significant decisions or breakthroughs
- **Session transitions**: When switching between major tasks
