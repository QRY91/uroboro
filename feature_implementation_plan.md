## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **1. Data Layer Enhancement**

#### **New Database Schema Extensions**
```sql
-- Journey-specific queries and indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_captures_timeline ON captures(timestamp, project);
CREATE INDEX idx_captures_journey ON captures(project, timestamp, tags);

-- Journey metadata tracking
CREATE TABLE journey_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    project STRING,
    session_type STRING, -- 'development', 'learning', 'integration'

    duration: totalDuration,
    easing: 'linear'
  })
  .add({
    targets: '.event-bubble',
    scale: [0, 1],
    opacity: [0, 1],
    duration: 500,
    delay: anime.stagger(200)
  }, 0)
  .add({
    targets: '.milestone-marker',
    rotate: '360deg',
    scale: [1, 1.2, 1],
    duration: 1000,
    easing: 'easeInOutElastic'
  }, '+=500');
