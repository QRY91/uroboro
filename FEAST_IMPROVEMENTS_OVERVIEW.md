# FEAST IMPROVEMENTS OVERVIEW

## Current Status: Phase 1-3 Complete ‚úÖ

The core feast functionality is working perfectly, but there are several opportunities to streamline, enhance, and polish the implementation. This document outlines improvement opportunities categorized by impact and priority.

## üî• High Impact, High Priority (Tackle First)

### 1. Interactive Terminal Detection & User Experience
**Problem**: Currently defaults to "archive all" in non-interactive environments, which may not be desired behavior.

**Improvement**: 
- Detect if running in interactive terminal vs CI/automation
- Add `--interactive` and `--non-interactive` flags for explicit control
- Better prompts with colored output and clearer instructions
- Add progress bars for large archive operations

**Impact**: Major UX improvement, prevents accidental mass archiving

### 2. Feast Configuration System
**Problem**: All feast settings are hardcoded in defaults.

**Improvement**:
```yaml
# ~/.uroboro/feast.yaml
feast:
  auto_enabled: true
  age_threshold_days: 30
  show_digest: true
  max_digest_items: 10
  rescue_enabled: true
  silent_mode: false
  archive_on_startup: true
  digest_format: "detailed" # compact, detailed, minimal
```

**Impact**: User control over feast behavior, personalization

### 3. Status Command Archive Integration
**Problem**: No way to see archived items or archive statistics.

**Improvement**:
```bash
uro status                    # Current active items
uro status --archived         # Browse archived items
uro status --all             # Active + archive summary
uro status --archive-stats   # Feast statistics
```

**Impact**: Complete visibility into system state, builds user confidence

## üöÄ High Impact, Medium Priority

### 4. Feast Analytics & Insights
**Problem**: No visibility into feast effectiveness or patterns.

**Improvement**:
- Track feast frequency and volume
- Identify most frequently archived projects/tags
- Show "rescue rate" (how often users save items from digest)
- Weekly/monthly feast summaries

**Example Output**:
```
üêç Feast Analytics (Last 30 days):
   Total feasted: 1,247 items
   Average per feast: 89 items
   Rescue rate: 12% (users kept 149 items)
   Top archived projects: [atelier: 45%, qry: 30%, esp32: 25%]
   Feast frequency: Every 3.2 days
```

**Impact**: Data-driven feast optimization, user insights

### 5. Smart Feast Thresholds
**Problem**: Fixed 30-day threshold doesn't adapt to user patterns.

**Improvement**:
- Adaptive thresholds based on capture frequency
- Project-specific feast settings (some projects need longer retention)
- Tag-based feast rules (e.g., keep "important" tagged items longer)
- Activity-based thresholds (busy periods = shorter retention)

**Impact**: Intelligent automation that adapts to user behavior

### 6. Feast Recovery & Unarchive
**Problem**: Once archived, items are hard to retrieve.

**Improvement**:
```bash
uro unarchive --search "oauth bug"     # Find and restore specific items
uro unarchive --project atelier --days 7  # Restore recent project work
uro unarchive --last-feast             # Undo last feast operation
```

**Impact**: Reduces user anxiety about losing important work

## üõ†Ô∏è Medium Impact, High Priority (Polish & Reliability)

### 7. Error Handling & Resilience
**Problem**: Limited error handling for edge cases.

**Improvement**:
- Graceful handling of database lock conflicts
- Retry logic for failed archive operations
- Rollback capability for interrupted feast operations
- Better error messages with suggested actions

**Impact**: Production reliability, user confidence

### 8. Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Large feast operations may be slow.

**Improvement**:
- Batch archive operations (process in chunks of 100)
- Background feast processing with progress updates
- Database query optimization for large datasets
- Lazy loading for digest display

**Impact**: Better experience with large datasets

### 9. Feast Dry Run Mode
**Problem**: Users can't preview what will be archived.

**Improvement**:
```bash
uro feast --dry-run          # Show what would be archived
uro feast --preview          # Interactive preview with selection
```

**Impact**: User confidence, prevents accidental over-archiving

## üéØ Medium Impact, Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

### 10. Cross-Tool Integration
**Problem**: Feast only works with uroboro captures.

**Improvement**:
- Integration with other QRY tools (wherewasi, examinator)
- Export archived data to external systems
- Import/sync with external productivity tools

**Impact**: Ecosystem cohesion, data portability

### 11. Archive Compression & Storage Optimization
**Problem**: Archived data may grow large over time.

**Improvement**:
- Compress old archived data (>90 days)
- Archive to separate database files by year/month
- Optional cloud backup of archived data
- Storage usage reporting

**Impact**: Long-term scalability, storage efficiency

### 12. Feast Scheduling & Automation
**Problem**: Feast only runs on manual trigger or status check.

**Improvement**:
- Cron-like scheduling for automatic feast operations
- Integration with system idle detection
- Feast triggers based on capture volume thresholds
- Weekend/evening batch processing

**Impact**: True "set and forget" automation

## üîÆ Low Impact, High Innovation (Future Vision)

### 13. AI-Powered Feast Intelligence
**Problem**: All archiving decisions are time-based.

**Improvement**:
- ML model to predict capture importance
- Content analysis for automatic tagging and retention
- Personal pattern recognition (user-specific importance signals)
- Seasonal relevance detection (bring back related old work)

**Impact**: Next-generation intelligent archiving

### 14. Feast Visualization & Journey Integration
**Problem**: No visual representation of feast history.

**Improvement**:
- Timeline visualization of feast operations
- Integration with journey/canvas functionality  
- Archive "archaeology" - visual exploration of old work
- Feast pattern visualization

**Impact**: Deep insight into work patterns and evolution

### 15. Collaborative Feast (Team Features)
**Problem**: Feast is purely individual.

**Improvement**:
- Team archive sharing for project handoffs
- Collaborative rescue decisions for shared work
- Archive knowledge transfer workflows
- Team feast analytics and benchmarking

**Impact**: Team productivity and knowledge management
