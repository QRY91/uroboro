# FEAST IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented two major improvements to the feast functionality that significantly enhance user experience and system visibility.

## ✅ Improvements Implemented

### 1. Interactive Terminal Detection & Enhanced UX

**Problem Solved**: Poor user experience with inconsistent input handling and lack of visual feedback.

**Improvements Delivered**:
- ✅ **Smart Terminal Detection**: Automatically detects interactive vs non-interactive environments
- ✅ **Colored Output**: ANSI color support for better visual hierarchy in terminals
- ✅ **Non-Interactive Handling**: Graceful fallback for CI/automation environments
- ✅ **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for large archive operations
- ✅ **Improved Prompts**: Clearer, more descriptive user interaction prompts

**Technical Implementation**:
```go
// Cross-platform terminal detection
func isTerminal() bool {
    fileInfo, err := os.Stdin.Stat()
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    return (fileInfo.Mode() & os.ModeCharDevice) != 0
}

// ANSI color support with fallback
func colorize(text, color string) string {
    if !isTerminal() {
        return text
    }
    // ... color codes
}
```

### 2. Status Command Archive Integration

**Problem Solved**: No visibility into archived data or feast statistics.

**Improvements Delivered**:
- ✅ **Archive Browsing**: `uro status --archived` to browse archived captures
- ✅ **Summary View**: `uro status --all` for active + archived overview
- ✅ **Archive Statistics**: `uro status --archive-stats` for feast analytics
- ✅ **Project Filtering**: Archive browsing respects project filters
- ✅ **Usage Integration**: Updated help text and command documentation

**New Commands**:
```bash
uro status --archived         # Browse archived captures
uro status --all             # Active + archived summary  
uro status --archive-stats   # Feast statistics
```

## 🧪 Test Results

### Enhanced UX Testing
```bash
# Interactive mode (with colors and proper prompts)
🐍 Auto-feast digest
